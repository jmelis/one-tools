OpenNebula CLI Tools
====================

This a collection of scripts useful for OpenNebula administrators. Their aim is
to improve the user experience in the shell with simple, short and elegant
scripts that use the power and simplicity of OpenNebula's CLI commands.

Contributions, hacks, ideas, improvements are more than welcome!

onelog
------

If no argument is passed it displays `oned.log`. One of these arguments can be passed:

- `econe`: econe-server.log
- `econe.error`: econe-server.error
- `occi`: occi-server.log
- `occi.error`: occi-server.error
- `sunstone`: sunstone-server.log
- `sunstone.error`: sunstone-server.error
- `ozones`: ozones-server.log
- `ozones.error`: ozones-server.error
- `VM_ID`: the vm.log is displayed

Example:

    $ onelog
    [ opens oned.log in your $PAGER ]
    $ onelog 10
    [ opens the vm.log for VM 10 in your $PAGER ]

oneinstantiate
--------------

A wrapper for the `onetemplate instantiate` command. It instantiates a template
using the name of the template as the Virtual Machine name:

    $ oneinstantiate 0
    onetemplate instantiate 0 -n ubuntu
    VM ID: 11


onedeploy
---------

Creates a Virtual Machine and deploys it instantaneously in the first available
host it founds:

    $ onedeploy vm_template.one

onereport
---------

Displays a summary of running Virtual Machines:

    $ onereport
    VM: 9
    NAME: one-9
    HOSTNAME: localhost
    VNC PORT: 5909
    IP: 172.16.0.205
    IP: 172.16.1.1

    VM: 10
    NAME: ttylinux
    HOSTNAME: localhost

onessh
------

SSH's into a running VM:

    $ onessh 9 -l root

onessh-copy-id
--------------

Copies the public key to a running VM identified by ID or by name. If a second
parameter is passed to the script, it will be used as the username.

    # To the same username
    $ onessh-copy-id 9
    Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    user@192.168.1.10's password:

    # To a different username
    $ onessh-copy-id 9 root
    Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    root@192.168.1.10's password:

onevnc
------

Opens the VNC console of a running VM:

    $ onevnc 9

oneirb
------

Enters an irb environment with all the OpenNebula libraries loaded. The instance
variable `@client` is available in the IRB shell.

    $ oneirb
    >> vm = VirtualMachine.new(VirtualMachine.build_xml('10'), @client);
    ?> vm.info;
    ?> vm['NAME']
    => "ttylinux"

onevcenterirb
-------------

Enters an irb environment with vCenter driver loaded:

    $ onevcenterirb
    $ vm = vm(0) # get vcenterdriver machine with opennebula id: 0
    $ vm.one_item['ID']
    => "0"
    $ vm.disk(0).managed?
    => false
    $ vm.disk(0).ds.class
    => RbVmomi::VIM::Datastore

oneconf
-------

This ruby script backs up and rewrites `oned.conf` and `sched.conf`, performing
the following changes:

#### oned.conf

- `MANAGER_TIMER`: 5 seconds
- `HOST_MONITORING_INTERVAL`: 10 seconds
- `VM_POLLING_INTERVAL`: 10 seconds
- Enables `TM_SSH`
- Enables `TM_DUMMY`
- Enables `IM_DUMMY`
- Enables `VMM_DUMMY`

#### sched.conf

- `SCHED_INTERVAL`: 5 seconds

onebootstrap
------------

This command should be executed only with a fresh OpenNebula installation. It
will create some resources:

* __host__: localhost with KVM configuration
* __datastore__: a file-system based user datastore
* __users__: Any users in the folder. If `default.user` exists, the following resources will be created inder his name.
* __vnet__: a few IPs in the 172.16.0.0/24 network connected to bridge `br0`
* __image__: an Ubuntu image (users will have to execute first
`bootstrap/image/download_ubuntu.sh`)
* __template__: an Ubuntu template ready to be instantiated

By default the command will look in the `bootstrap/` directory. However, a
different path may be provided as an argument.

All of these resources can be customized by editing the files inside
`bootstrap/`. Other resources can be added and they will also be created.


The datastore where the images will be instantiated needs to have `DEFAULT =
YES` inside the template. This is only necessary if more than one datastore is
created.

onecast
-------

This tool that can rewrite parts of a VM template substituting the variables it
contains by some values that the user provides. It also gets values from the
environment if the values are not explicitly provided by the user and can also
have a default value so they will be translated to something meaningful if not
found by other methods.

An example of a VM template meaningful to onecast can be this one:

    NAME    = "${NAME}"
    CPU     = ${CPU|1.0}
    VCPU    = ${CPU|1}
    MEMORY  = ${MEMORY|512}
    DISK    = [
        SOURCE  = "${HOME}/images/vm.img",
        TARGET  = sda
    ]

In this example we can see that the placeholder for the variable values is
specified with `${VARIABLE}`. The name of the variable is case sensitive and
this will be translated to its value (user provided or from the environment) or
left blank if not found. We have to be careful with variables not set or they
will render the template unusable in some cases. To overcome this problem, and
also to give some values that the user may not want to modify, default values
can be provided alongside the variable name. Variable names with default values
are specified with `${VARIABLE|default value}`. Doing so if the variable is not
set by the user in the command line or found in the environment it will be
substituted by the default value.

It is also very useful to use environment variables to get some information
specific to the user, in this example we suppose every user has a file called
`images/vm.img` in their home directory so we use `$HOME` environment variable
to point to it.

To generate the final template we use the this command:

    $ onecast -d NAME="test vm" test.one
    NAME    = "test vm"
    CPU     = 1.0
    VCPU    = 1
    MEMORY  = 512
    DISK    = [
        SOURCE  = "/home/oneuser/images/vm.img",
        TARGET  = sda
    ]

We have to specify the template file to the onecast script and we can also
provide variables using _-d_ option. This option will have an argument in this
form `NAME=value` that will be used to substitute any variable in the template
with that name. More than one of those variables can be added in the command
line. As another example to illustrate this we can also set the memory to 1Gb
issuing this command:

    $ onecast -d NAME="test vm" -d MEMORY=1024 test.one
    NAME    = "test vm"
    CPU     = 1.0
    VCPU    = 1
    MEMORY  = 1024
    DISK    = [
        SOURCE  = "/home/oneuser/images/vm.img",
        TARGET  = sda
    ]

The output of the command can then be redirected to a file and use it to create
a new VM or use the parameter _-c_ so the VM is automatically sent to
OpenNebula:

    $ onecast -d NAME="test vm" -d MEMORY=1024 test.one -c
    ID: 9

oneping
-------

Pings a VM:

    $ oneping 9

oneip
-----

Returns the ip of a VM:

    $ oneip --check 172.16.77.134
    $ oneip -c 172.16.77.134
    $ oneip --get [NET_ID]
    $ oneip -g [NET_ID]

Useful for things like:

    $ scp myfile root@`oneip 0`:

onefind
-------

Finds a value in object information:

    $ onefind gold TEMPLATE/OBJ_TYPE
    HOSTS
    -----
    2

    DATASTORES
    ----------
    0

onedepkidnap
------------

Kidnaps deploy drv_action xml and writes it to /tmp/one_deploy_xmldrvaction. Add binding.pry to execute deploy action step by step.

    $ onedepkidnap 0
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: LCM_INIT
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: PROLOG
    Waiting for VM 26 in state BOOT_FAILURE, got: BOOT_FAILURE

    Deploy kidnapped. Execute the following to debug the deploy:
     /home/tinova/dev/one/master/var/remotes/vmm/vcenter/deploy '/home/tinova/dev/one/master/var/vms/26/deployment.0' 'Cluster' 26 Cluster

    Remember to restore the deploy script afterwards:
     mv /home/tinova/dev/one/master/var/remotes/vmm/vcenter/deploy.bk /home/tinova/dev/one/master/var/remotes/vmm/vcenter/deploy
